# Challenges
Coding challenges in Python

# Maximum squares challenge:
Here the aim of the challenge is to find a square of ones in a random binary matrix. For example:
0 0 0 0 1 1 \n
1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 1 0 0
The output here should be 9

# Consensus challenge:
Given a matrix of DNA sequences, take a consensus strand and calculate the consensus matrix for each nucleotide
