# Challenges
Coding challenges in Python

## Maximum squares challenge:
Here the aim of the challenge is to find a square of ones in a random binary matrix. For example:

0 0 0 0 1 1 

1 1 1 0 0 0

1 1 1 0 1 1

1 1 1 0 0 1

0 0 1 1 0 0

The output here should be 9

## Consensus challenge:
Given a matrix of DNA sequences, take a consensus strand and calculate the consensus matrix for each nucleotide

## Challenge strairs:
There is a stairs with 100 steps. It is possible to have different routes to the top of the stairs. For example skipping each step. The question is: In how many ways can you climb the stairs given that it is only alowwed to take either one stairs or skip a stairs?
